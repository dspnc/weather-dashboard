# weather-dashboard
This project will utilize server side APIs to retrieve weather information for different cities and dynamically update the HTML and CSS accordingly, while also using local storage to store persistent data.

- What was your motivation? 
The motivation of this project is to build a simple weather app that takes advantage of an open API to make calls for specific data points based on fetch requests with specific data to get

- Why did you build this project? 
I built this project to begin getting familiar with making API calls, while also practicing using JS to dynamically update DOM elements and local storage to store persistent data across page reloads.

- What problem does it solve?
This project solves the problem of generating a weather forecast report for any input location. It can look up a city on the openweather API and then find the latitude and longitudes needed to make more in depth API calls for weather data over the next week.

- What did you learn?
I learned how to review API documentation to see what data is included in the JSON API response file, and then to edit query parameters in the API request URL to get specific data points.
